# Colorful Console

## Motivation

Sometimes, we want to print some logs with styles on app(library), But we don't want to use third-party libraries (care about the bundle size or something).

[Colorful Console](https://colorful-console.vercel.app) is an interactive online website that allows you to customize the style of the log and test its output directly in the browser or terminal.
